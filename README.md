# Polynomial Root finding script

This is badly put together script which finds the root of any polynomial given a certain start and end point and step

## Usage

```
findRootsFast([1, 2, 3]) # Your coefficents here

findRootsFast([1, 2, 3], start=-100, end=-100) # keyword arguments

findRootsWell([1, 2, 3]) # efficient method, but usually slower
```
